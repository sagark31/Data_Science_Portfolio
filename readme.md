# Data Science Portfolio
This Repository of data science projects conducted by me for academic, self-learning, and recreational purposes. Jupyter notebooks are used to present the data.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Boston Housing Prices Prediction](https://github.com/sagark31/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/portfolio/Boston%20Housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model that uses multiple statistical analysis tools to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market. Using machine learning, I determined the optimal price at which a client might sell their home.
	- [Finding Donors(Supervised Learning)](https://github.com/sagark31/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/portfolio/Finding%20Donor/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
	- [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/sagark31/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/portfolio/Customer%20segmentation/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset comprising information on various consumers' annual spending amounts (given in monetary units) across numerous product categories in order to find internal structure, trends, and knowledge.
	- [Clustering on Credit Card Dataset](https://github.com/sagark31/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/portfolio/Creditcard%20Clustering/Credit_Card_Clustering.ipynb): Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that those in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
	- [Telecom_Churn_Prediction&Analysis](https://github.com/sagark31/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/portfolio/Telecom%20churn/TELE_COM_CHURN_ML.ipynb):In order to anticipate the churn, I constructed various Machine Learning models after performing statistical and exploratory data analysis on the dataset. This included managing missing values, duplicate values, correlations between variables, and skewness of the data.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, EDA

- ### Natural Language Processing
	- [Sentiment Analysis for Tweets](https://github.com/sagark31/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/portfolio/Twitter%20Sentiment%20and%20Stock%20Market%20Analysis/Twitter%20sentiment%20analysis.ipynb): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine. 


	_Tools: NLTK, scikit_
	
- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/sagark31/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/portfolio/Titanic%20EDA/Titanic%20Dataset%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
	- [Twitter Stock Market Analysis](https://github.com/sagark31/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/portfolio/Twitter%20Sentiment%20and%20Stock%20Market%20Analysis/Twitter%20Stock%20Market%20Analysis%20using%20Python.ipynb): Twitter is one of the popular social media applications where people share what they feel in a limited number of words. Twitter is popular but not in the stock market. As Twitter is being delisted from the New York stock exchange, here I analyze the complete timeline of Twitter in the stock market.
	- [911 Calls - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/sagark31/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/portfolio/911%20calls%20EDA/911%20Calls%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis of the 911 calls dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.
